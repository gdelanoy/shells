##### TO DO

- "VIEW MODE" with multi handling to cut, paste etc. and create more macros
- "buffer" handling and interaction
- keybindings => implement fzf --expect
- multiselection in fzf
- give -e option to evaluate console commands on start up
- more console commands and integration of tools like z, history, bookmarks
- check all against mksh and zsh
- comments
- take OS X into consideration
- rewrite code from liquidprompt
- checkout, how to work with multiplexers and/or embedding of tty emulators
- think about fzf-completion.bash
